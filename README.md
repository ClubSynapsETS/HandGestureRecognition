# HandGestureRecognition

The main goal for this project, here at [SynapETS](https://synapsets.etsmtl.ca/), is to develop gesture recognition algorithms that can be integrated into smart prosthetics. These algorithms can interpret EMG signals from a particular limb and recognize the intended movement of the user.

This project was also part of our contest entry for the 2019 NeuroTechX Open challenge. Here is a link to our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txTTXi7mKF0&feature=youtu.be).
